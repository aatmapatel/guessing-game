# guessing-game

###Project: ISC3U0 course project.

##Task: Select one of the following games 1. the guessing game 2. black jack and create an user friendly and engaging Java project.

##Criteria: You must include five levels:
   1. The computer will generate a random number between 1-100. You are to guess this number by inputting your guess into the console. The computer will inform you if you are \"too low\" or \"too high\. You have unlimited guesses until you get the number correct

2. You are to input a range of values you want to guess from. The computer will select a number from the range you have provided. Your guessess will be counted and totalled at the end.

3. You will have a maximum of 10 guesses. If you guess correct before your tenth attempt you win this level. If you fail to guess correctly by your tenth attempt the computer wins. Your time will also be tracked, you will be awarded 10 points if you complete the level before or at 20 seconds and will lose 5 points if you are above 20 seconds. 

4. You will swtich roles with the computer, the computer will guess your number. You are to indicate if the guess is \"low\", \"high\" or \"correct\" to the computer. You can trust that the computer will not cheat. 

5. The computer will play against itself. You will see all attempts, how long it takes, and total computer points as well. 

##Summary of Tech Stack: The only programing language that was used to create this simulation was Java. The development enviornment platform which was utilized to compile the code was Eclipse IDE.

##Functionality: The purpose or function of the program is to showcase the programmers ability to manipulate user input, incorporate the random class as well as utilize conditional statements (if-else, switch case, for-while etc.) to generate dependable outputs to the user in correspondence to the users input or computers calculations.

##Design: The entire program runs in the console of the IDE. The layout of the instructions are properly indent, a line is inserted after each level is completed and there are spaces between each number guess. The program is created to be interactive and user friendly overall.

##Run Locally:
- Download files onto desktop one by one
- prompt a web browser and view the HTML pages

##Tech Stack:
- Java
